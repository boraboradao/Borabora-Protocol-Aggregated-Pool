# Introduction

BoraBora PVE is an underlying liquidity multiplexing protocol. Pooled liquidity will be dynamically shared across trading assets to achieve high utilization. As the counterparty of traders, the liquidity provider's core of liquidity supplying is to complete the order without slipping, making it the most capital-efficient derivatives liquidity supply model.

In the order book model, the long and short positions are counterparties to each other. The profit of longs is the loss of shorts, the funding rates fluctuate between longs and shorts, commissions and liquidation are transferred by the exchange.

LP is the counterparty of all traders on Borabora. The profit of traders is the loss of LP. On the opposite, the loss of traders is the profit of LP. LP receives the trading fee and the funding rate as sources of revenue.

LP's losses and profits will be shared equally based on the LPâ€™s liquidity deposit in the pool.
